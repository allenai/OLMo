# Script for building triton wheels.

# This does NOT need to be run on LUMI or any machine with AMD GPUs, but it does need to be run
# on a Linux machine. I've tested this on cirrascale in a Beaker interactive environment.

# Extra (non-Python) dependencies:
# zlib1g-dev - 'sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev'

set -eu

# Configuration options:
workdir=/tmp/triton

# Clean and prepare working directory.

# Clone source code.
echo "Cloning source code from ${triton_remote} @ ${triton_ref}"
