# Tango settings file
#
# See https://ai2-tango.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/settings.html
# for a list and description of all available fields.

# ❗Fields that should be updated are marked with 👇

# ❗This config uses a non-default beaker image `akshitab/olmo-eval-image-2`. 
# ❗This image was created by installing all requirements for the evaluation module, so it can be used as it is.
# ❗`eval-env` (`venv_name`) is the name of the conda environment on that image, which contains all required packages.
# ❗If any packages need to be updated, the image will be updated. If you prefer to use your own beaker image, you can
# ❗update it with fields `beaker_image` and `venv_name`. 

# ❗If you require any additional packages, you can uncomment the
# ❗`install_cmd` field below and add your installation. Note that this will be run for every single step, so if it takes
# ❗a long time to install, the default beaker image can be updated.
