# 仇듒his config uses a non-default beaker image `akshitab/olmo-eval-image-2`. 
# 仇듒his image was created by installing all requirements for the evaluation module, so it can be used as it is.
# 仇`eval-env` (`venv_name`) is the name of the conda environment on that image, which contains all required packages.
# 仇듈f any packages need to be updated, the image will be updated. If you prefer to use your own beaker image, you can
# 仇듯pdate it with fields `beaker_image` and `venv_name`. 

# 仇듈f you require any additional packages, you can uncomment the
# 仇`install_cmd` field below and add your installation. Note that this will be run for every single step, so if it takes
# 仇드 long time to install, the default beaker image can be updated.
